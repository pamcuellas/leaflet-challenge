# Tectonic plates versus seismic activity

In this Leaflet map application, we can check out how the earthquakes are closely connected to tectonic plates. The visualization combines the dataset of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), that is a JSON URL with Earthquakes data from the Past 7 Days', updated every 5 minutes, and a tectonic plates JSON file available at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.

#### Leaflet, GeoJSON, D3, HTML5, and CSS3 are the technologies used to build this application.

#### The app is available on the link below if you consider to check it out.
